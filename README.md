- Consistent Hashing : Consistent Hashing is a technique used in distributed computing to efficiently distribute data or load across multiple nodes or servers while minimizing the amount of data that needs to be relocated when nodes are added or removed from the system. It ensures that the distribution of data remains relatively stable even as the number of nodes changes.
